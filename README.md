## Prerequisites

1. Have docker installed and running

## Getting Started

After cloning this repository to your local machine, run these commands from the root folder.

```bash
chmod +x ./start.sh
```

```bash
./start.sh
```

Have patience, especially on the first run it will take time.

Eventually your browser will open up and show you the project on localhost.

If you're not seeing anything yet, then it's most likely because Vite needs to compile some dependencies still. After a couple seconds and a refresh, you should be presented with the home screen.

In the beginning you'll have no data of course, so there's not much to see. There's a button to let the backend generate a bunch of data if you like to easy start testing things like the sorting or pagination.
